*This Project is to enhance basic skills. 
*Using only basic HTML, CSS and JS. 
*No extra tech or framework or library is used.


*We are using "KeyboardEvent.code" property in this project. This property is useful
when we want to handle keys based on their physical position on the input device rather
than the characters associated with those keys. 

*This is especially common when writing code to handle input for games that simulate a 
gamepad like environment using keys on 
the keyboard.
